**DESCRIPTION OF THE DESIGN-TASK**

The UI designers are to make the user's interaction as simple and efficient as possible, in terms of accomplishing user goals.

*They are to translate creative software design concepts and ideas into reality using front-end technologies. Design and create a software interfaces by prioritizing users requirements over technology limitations and contraints.*

They should be able to facilitate the interaciton between the user and the web app with a well-structured layout and equally work on the appearance and the way the Project (Hostel-Checkin) performs its activities.

*The UI designers not only focuses on the aesthetics but also maximizes reponsiveness, efficiency and accesssibility of this Project.*

The designer is also responsible for bringing the pages to life using the wireframes created to mock up each page.

**Some guildlines to achieving a good design includes:**

- Make elements such as buttons and other common elements perform predictably so users can unconsciously use them everywhere.

- Maintain high discoverability. Clearly label icons and include well-indicated affordances.

- Keep interfaces simple and create an "invisible" feel. Every element should serve a purpose.

- Respect the user's eye and attention regarding layout; focus on hierarchy and readability.

- Minimize the number of actions for performing tasks but focus on one chief function per page; guide users by indicating preferred       actions. Ease complex tasks by using progressive disclosure.

- Put controls near objects users want to control where necessary.

- Keep users informed via system responses/actions with feedback.

- Consider defaults to reduce user burdens (e.g., pre-fill forms)

- Use reusable design patterns to guide behaviour regarding navigation and search functions.

- Use colors, brightness, and contrast to draw attention to key features. Always provide next steps users can deduce naturally,           whatever their context.
